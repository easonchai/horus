      ## Notes
      This withdrawal would remove your funds from the Beefy vault.
      In a real implementation, this would:
      
      1. Connect to the vault contract using your wallet provider
      2. Call the withdraw function with your token ID
      3. Confirm the transaction on the blockchain
      
      ## Security Considerations
      Withdrawing funds during times of high volatility might result in slippage.
      Consider the market conditions before executing this withdrawal.

      * Position Manager: ${positionManagerAddress}
      * Wallet Address: ${walletAddress}
      * Status: Simulated
      
      ## Process
      This withdrawal would execute in two steps:
      
      1. Call \`decreaseLiquidity\` to remove ${liquidityPercentage} of your liquidity
      2. Call \`collect\` to receive the withdrawn tokens
      
      ## Estimated Returns
      In a real implementation, this would calculate and show:
      * Estimated Token A: X.XXX
      * Estimated Token B: Y.YYY
      * Collected Fees: Z.ZZZ
      
      ## Security Considerations
      Withdrawing liquidity during high volatility periods may result in suboptimal returns.
      Consider market conditions before proceeding.

      Emergency withdrawals should only be used during legitimate security threats.
      This action may incur higher gas fees and potential slippage.
